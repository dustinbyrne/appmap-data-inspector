# AppMap data inspector
Analyze and label data objects captured in an AppMap JSON file. This is a proof of concept in surfacing sensitive information and data usage, intended or not.

If you'd like to capture your own AppMap data, visit [appland.org](https://appland.org/#recording-clients). Data loaded into this application is never transmitted outside of your local browser.

Demo available here: coming soon
